## Title & Abstracts

**Thick points in a random square subdivision model generated by Bernoulli trials** <br/> 
(Elena Gribelyuk, Ruoxi Li, Iris Rosenblum-Sellers, Henry Zhang)

*Random planar maps are fundamental models of random discrete surfaces with applications in combinatorics, probability, physics, and computer science. 
We consider a sequence of random planar maps embedded in the unit square defined in terms of Bernoulli trials with fixed parameter \(p \in (0,1)\).  This is a simplified version of a sequence of random planar maps that has been used to approximate a continuum model of random geometry known as Liouville quantum gravity. 
We analyze the set of \(\alpha\)-thick points, which are points in the square at which the sequence of random planar maps is asymptotically "\(\alpha\)-concentrated".  A Euclidean-typical point is \(p\)-thick, so the set of points with thickness $\alpha$ has measure zero for each \(\alpha \neq p\). Our main result computes the a.s.\ Hausdorff dimension of the set of \(\alpha\)-thick points, which gives a finer description of the size of the set that distinguishes between different values of \(\alpha\).*

**Traders in a Strange Land: Agent-based discrete-event market simulation of the Figgie card game** <br/>
(Anthony Ozerov, Steven DiSilvio, Yu (Anna) Luo)

*Figgie is a card game that approximates open-outcry commodities trading. We design strategies for
Figgie and study their performance and the resulting market behavior. To do this, we develop a flexible
agent-based discrete-event market simulation in which agents operating under our strategies can play
Figgie. Our simulation builds upon previous work by simulating latencies between agents and the market
in a novel and efficient way. The fundamentalist strategy we develop takes advantage of Figgie’s unique
notion of asset value, which allows different traders to have different but equally valid estimates of value.
We find that the fundamentalist strategy is, on average, the profit-maximizing one in all combinations
of strategies tested. We develop a strategy which estimates value by observing orders sent by other
agents, and find that it limits the success of fundamentalists. We also find that the chartist strategies
implemented, including one from the literature, fail by going into feedback loops in the small Figgie
market. Positive autocorrelation in the returns in at least one strategy combination indicates that a
more robust chartist strategy could be successful in Figgie. We further develop a bootstrap method
for statistically comparing strategies in a zero-sum game. Our results demonstrate the wide-ranging
applicability of agent-based discrete-event simulations in studying markets.*

**Accounting for Disruptions in the Structural Connectome in a Network Diffusion Model for Tau Spread** <br/>
(Maria Stuebner, Silvia Toderas, Yiqi Wang)

*Recent neuropathological studies of Alzheimer’s disease suggest that aggregation
of the tau protein spreads across connected neurons in an activity-dependent manner,
contributing to cognitive decline. While a linear diffusion model based on quantitative
pathology is widely accepted and used to predict the progression of tau pathology, all
first applications of this model to tau spread fail to take into consideration the factor of
neuronal death, which would cast a significant impact on several parameters influencing
the spread. To allow for more accurate predictions, we are building onto the existing
framework by incorporating neuronal loss. This modifies the overall connectome of the
brain and in turn changes the spread dynamics.*

**A Generalized Multi-Agent Framework To Simulate Deviant Mining Strategies on Bitcoin-like Blockchains** <br/>
(Ketan Jog, Andrew Magid, Oliver Li)

*A big challenge in evaluating the profitability of deviant mining strategies on bitcoin-like blockchain
systems is the lack of a generalized framework that sufficiently describes and simulates each strategy.
We target this lacuna in blockchain mining literature. Our work is twofold. After a brief description
of the honest protocol, we first present a taxonomy of existing deviant mining strategies that is
succinctly parameterized. We define a set of variables that can describe every mining strategy we
have come across in the literature: Selfish Mining, Smart Mining, Smarter Mining, Lead-Stubborn
Mining, Intermittent Selfish Mining, and MDP-based formulations. Although individual studies
have been done to show the effectiveness of these selfish mining techniques, there has not been
a consolidatory work that compares the relative effectiveness of each strategy. In past work, the
effectiveness of deviant mining has been established using varying assumptions and frameworks,
making comparison between them extremely difficult. The second part of our work aims to gener-
alize Agent-Blockchain interactions with a single simulation-model which models agent dynamics
independently from the blockchain state. This extensible system simulates the applicability of said
strategies on blockchain systems with proof-of-work consensus protocols. We analyze the profitabil-
ity of each mining strategy, and discuss how this advantage changes upon adjustment of certain
parameters in the blockchain protocol.*
