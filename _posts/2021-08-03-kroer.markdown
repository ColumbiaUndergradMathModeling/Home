*Abstract*

I will introduce some basics of game theory: Nash equilibrium and the special case of minimax theorems. Then, I will introduce the idea of online convex optimization, and show how this leads to constructive proofs of minimax theorems, as well as a practical method for solving real-world large-scale games.

Basics of convex optimization: Ch. 2.1-2.3, 3.1-3.3
