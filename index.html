  <h1 id="columbia-undergraduate-mathematical-modeling">Columbia Undergraduate Mathematical Modeling</h1>
  <p>Columbia Undergraduate Mathematical Modeling is a program for collaborative undergraduate research experiences in mathematical modeling. The purpose of the program is two-fold: to introduce the participants to some of the advanced topics in mathematical and statistical modeling and simulation encountered in modern interdisciplinary research; and to allow the participants to propose and develop collaborative interdisciplinary research projects under the joint mentorship of Columbia graduate students and faculty.</p>
  <p>There are four main activities that students will participate in during the program:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Lectures in mathematical modeling</li>
  <li>Interdisciplinary group project</li>
  <li>Skills and curriculum development</li>
    <li> Social activities with other students from summer research programs </li>
  </ul>
<!--   <p>There will also be several social activities with students from other summer undergraduate research programs offered by the mathematics department.</p> -->

  <h2 id="two-branches"> WORKSHOPS vs CSUREMM</h2> 
  <p> There are two main sessions for the program to fulfill the program's two-fold purpose: <a href="https://columbiaundergradmathmodeling.github.io/Home/workshops/"> the Workshop</a> and the <a href="https://columbiaundergradmathmodeling.github.io/Home/csuremm/">Columbia Summer Undergraduate Research Experience in Mathematical Modeling (CSUREMM). </a> The first happens during the academic Fall and Spring semesters and is open to all students, whether inexperienced or advanced. The second is during the summer and for students with more serious research interest in mathematical modeling. </p>

<!--   <h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h2>
  <p>The program is open to any continuing Barnard/Columbia undergraduate student, independent of U.S. residency. Women and historically underrepresented minorities are particularly encouraged to apply.</p>
  <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
  <p>Previous coursework in linear algebra, probability, and ordinary differential equations is required. Previous experience with programming is highly recommended, but not mandatory.</p> -->
