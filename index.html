  <h2 id="columbia-summer-undergraduate-research-experiences-in-mathematical-modeling">Columbia Summer Undergraduate Research Experiences in Mathematical Modeling</h2>
  <p>CSUREMM is a full-time eight-week summer program for collaborative undergraduate research experiences in mathematical modeling. The purpose of the program is two-fold: to introduce the participants to some of the advanced topics in mathematical and statistical modeling and simulation encountered in modern interdisciplinary research; and to allow the participants to propose and develop collaborative interdisciplinary research projects under the joint mentorship of Columbia graduate students and faculty.</p>
  <p>There are three main activities that students will participate in during the program:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Lectures in mathematical modeling</li>
  <li>Interdisciplinary group project</li>
  <li>Skills and curriculum development</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There will also be several social activities with students from other summer undergraduate research programs offered by the mathematics department.</p>
  <h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h2>
  <p>The program is open to any continuing Barnard/Columbia undergraduate student, independent of U.S. residency. Women and historically underrepresented minorities are particularly encouraged to apply.</p>
  <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
  <p>Previous coursework in linear algebra, probability, and ordinary differential equations is required. Previous experience with programming is highly recommended, but not mandatory.</p>
