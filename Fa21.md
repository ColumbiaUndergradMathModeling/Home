# CUMMW Fall 2021

## Columbia Undergraduate Mathematical Modeling Workshop
### Fall 2021

CUMMW is an undergraduate workshop offered to all Columbia students interested in learning more about real world mathematical and statistical modeling. The workshop consists of a series of lectures and hands-on seminars led by faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students. Participating students are gradually introduced to the full range of activities involved in pursuing scientific research, including project design, data analysis and interpretation, modeling and simulation, literature review, scientific writing, and interactive collaboration. 

Students of all majors and levels of mathematical background are invited to participate. 

The workshop also serves as preparation for students interested in participating in the [Mathematical/Interdisciplinary Contest in Modelling (MCM/ICM)](https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/index.html), an annual international competition where teams of up to three undergraduate students work together to produce a paper on a real world open-ended problem. Teams of three students that complete the workshop will be sponsored to register for the MCM/ICM competition taking place February 17-21, 2022. 
_____

The workshop dates and registration details TBA.
