# CSUREMM 

## Columbia Summer Undergraduate Research Experiences in Mathematical Modeling


CSUREMM is a full-time eight-week summer program for collaborative undergraduate research experiences in mathematical modeling. The purpose of the program is two-fold: to introduce the participants to some of the advanced topics in mathematical and statistical modeling and simulation encountered in modern interdisciplinary research; and to allow the participants to propose and develop collaborative interdisciplinary research projects under the joint mentorship of Columbia graduate students and faculty.

There are three main activities that students will participate in during the program:

- Lectures in mathematical modeling
- Interdisciplinary group project
- Skills and curriculum development

There will also be several (remote) social activities with students from other summer undergraduate research programs offered by the mathematics department.

## Eligibility
The program is open to any continuing Barnard/Columbia undergraduate student, independent of U.S. residency. Women and historically underrepresented minorities are particularly encouraged to apply.

## Background
Previous coursework in linear algebra, probability, and ordinary differential equations is required. Previous experience with programming is highly recommended, but not mandatory.
